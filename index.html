			<h3>Personal Background</h3>
			<p>I am from the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador. I came to Charlotte 2.5 years ago to study.</p>

			<h3>Professional Background</h3>
			<p>I am a TA for ITSC 2181. I volunteered in the Galapagos National Park during the Summer, working with the Software Development team. I mostly worked on the responsiveness of a data recollection application and also compiled it on macOS to make it work on iOS devices.</p>

			<h3>Academic Background</h3>
			<p>I am a Junior studying Computer Science at UNCC with a concentration in Software Engineering. I studied two years at CPCC and then transferred here.</p>

			<h3>Background in this Subject</h3>
			<p>I have never worked with frontend development. I have always wanted to learn about it, so this will be the time.</p>

			<h3>Primary Computer Platform</h3>
			<p>Windows 11 (Always.).</p>

			<h3>Courses I'm Taking &amp Why</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>ITSC3112</strong> - Design &amp Implementation of Object-oriented Systems: It is a project-based course, so it will be great to have something to add to my resume.</li>
				<li><strong>ITIS3135</strong> - Web Application Design and Development: I am eager to learn about web development. I think it is very important to know how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
				<li><strong>ITSC3146</strong> - Intro Operating Systems &amp Networking: I have to take this course, but I also want to learn about Operating Systems because they are essential.</li>
				<li><strong>ITSC3155</strong> - Software Engineering: This course is literally named after my major, “Software Engineering.” It’s a very important class to understand how the work environment operates.</li>
				<li><strong>STAT2122</strong> - Intro to Probability &amp Statistics: I have to take this course in order to graduate. It is my last math-related course (hopefully).</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember Me By</h3>
			<p>I’m from the Galapagos Islands, where Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution originates.</p>
