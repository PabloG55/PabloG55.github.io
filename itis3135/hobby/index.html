                    <strong>Personal Background:</strong>
                    My name is Pablo Garces. I grew up near the ocean, which sparked my love for swimming at an early age. I have been swimming since senior year of high school, focusing on freestyle and butterfly strokes.

                <li>
                    <strong>Background in Swimming:</strong>
                    I've participated in some competitions and have been training rigorously to improve my times in the 50y freestyle and butterfly. My goal is to compete in national-level events in the future.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Training &amp Goals:</strong>
                    I swim three days a week, focusing on technique and endurance. In addition, I do dryland training two days a week to improve my strength. My main goals are to break the 26-second mark in the 50y freestyle and achieve the nationals cut for the 50 fly.

            <p>Swimming is a water-based sport and activity where individuals use various strokes to propel themselves through the water. It can be enjoyed recreationally, as a competitive sport, or even for therapeutic purposes. There are four main strokes used in swimming:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Freestyle</strong>: The fastest and most popular stroke, where swimmers alternate their arms in an overhand motion while kicking with a flutter kick.</li>
                <li><strong>Backstroke</strong>: Swimmers lie on their back, using an alternating arm movement and a flutter kick.</li>
                <li><strong>Breaststroke</strong>: Both arms move in a half-circle motion simultaneously, paired with a frog-like kick.</li>
                <li><strong>Butterfly</strong>: Swimmers move their arms together in a circular motion and use a dolphin kick, creating a wave-like body movement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Competitive swimming involves racing these strokes over various distances, with popular events including the 50m, 100m, and 200m sprints, as well as longer distances. Competitive swimmers train to improve endurance, strength, and technique, aiming to increase their speed and efficiency in the water.</p>

                <figcaption><i>Create an image of a person swimming with harsh sun.</i></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The best time to swim really depends on the type of swimming you’re doing and your goals. If you’re training for a triathlon, early morning swims are ideal to avoid the intense sun and get your body accustomed to early activity, which can be helpful for race day.</p>
            <p>For pool training, though, you have more flexibility—any time the pool is open works, so you can choose what fits your schedule best.</p>
            <p>Personally, I train on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays from 5:45 to 7:15, which gives me a consistent routine that fits my school schedule.</p>

            <p>Some of the best swimming locations include public pools, lakes, and oceans that are safe and have clean water. Each location offers unique experiences for swimmers of all levels.</p>
            <p>For UNCC students, the best locations are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>UREC Pool:</strong> Open from 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM, ideal for personal training and casual swimming.</li>

            <p>Proper swimming techniques include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Breathing Correctly:</strong> Proper breathing is essential for maintaining rhythm and conserving energy. Try to breathe in through your mouth and out through your nose while turning your head to the side. Practicing breathing drills can help you find a comfortable rhythm.</li>
                <li><strong>Using the Right Stroke:</strong> Different strokes—freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke, and butterfly—require distinct techniques. Start by learning one stroke at a time, focusing on body mechanics, arm movements, and kicking techniques specific to each stroke.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintaining Good Body Position:</strong> Keeping your body streamlined helps reduce drag. Try to keep your head aligned with your body, looking down or slightly forward, and engage your core to stay balanced in the water.</li>
                <li><strong>Improving Kick Efficiency:</strong> Your legs should provide a steady kick without excessive splash. Small, consistent kicks from your hips, rather than from your knees, will propel you forward without wasting energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Focusing on Arm Technique:</strong> Ensure your arms are extending fully and pulling back effectively to maximize each stroke. Proper hand entry and a high elbow position during freestyle can increase your speed and power.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's important to practice regularly to build endurance and refine your technique. Consider working with a coach or joining a swim class for personalized feedback and guidance.</p>
