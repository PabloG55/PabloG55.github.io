                    <strong>Professional Background:</strong>
                    In addition to competing, I volunteer as a coach for a local swimming team. I help young swimmers improve their technique and prepare for competitions. It’s been a rewarding experience to see them progress.

                    <strong>Background in Swimming:</strong>
                    I've participated in several regional competitions and have been training rigorously to improve my times in the 50y freestyle and butterfly. My goal is to compete in national-level events in the future.
