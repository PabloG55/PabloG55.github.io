        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.nike.com/">Well Designed Website</a></h3>
            <p>Nike's website really does a great job of showcasing the brand's identity. The layout is clean and visually appealing, which makes it easy to navigate</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: They utilize classic black and white colors, along with some words in bold. This not only enhances readability but also draws attention to key products and important calls to action.</li>
                <li>Repetition: Nike does a solid job of maintaining consistency across its pages. The design style, fonts, and color scheme are all similar, which really helps reinforce brand recognition.</li>
                <li>Alignment: Elements on the page are well-aligned. This gives the site a structured and organized look that guides the user’s eye through the content smoothly.</li>
                <li>Proximity: Related items, like product categories and promotional banners, are grouped together nicely. This makes it easy for users to navigate and find exactly what they’re looking for.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In summary, the Nike website is a fantastic example of effective design principles in action. It creates an intuitive user experience that communicates the brand's message well and really encourages consumer engagement.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu">Terribly Designed Website</a></h3>
            <p>The Yale School of Art web pages are an example of what shouldn’t be done. The color scheme is mismatched, which makes it hard on the eyes. Some elements are too small to read, while others, like the background, are overly large and distracting. Overall, the site lacks organization, making it difficult to navigate.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: The contrast is poorly executed, with text blending into the background, an excessive use of colors, making it hard to read. There’s not enough differentiation between elements, which can confuse users. </li>
                <li>Repetition: There’s a lack of consistency across the pages. The design elements vary too much, which hurts brand recognition and makes the site feel disconnected.</li>
                <li>Alignment: Many elements appear misaligned, giving the site a chaotic look. This lack of alignment disrupts the flow and makes it challenging for users to follow the content.</li>
                <li>Proximity: Related items are everywhere without clear grouping. This lack of proximity makes it difficult for visitors to find information efficiently, leading to a frustrating user experience.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In conclusion, the Yale School of Art website demonstrates several design failures. It needs significant improvements in its layout and organization to create a more user-friendly experience.</p>
