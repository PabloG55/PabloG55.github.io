						<li><strong>ITSC3155 - Software Engineering:</strong> This course is literally named after my major, “Software Engineering.” It’s a very important class to understand how the work environment operates.</li>
						<li><strong>STAT2122 - Intro to Probability &amp Statistics:</strong> I have to take this course in order to graduate. It is my last math-related course (hopefully).</li>
